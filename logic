Objective
We aim to develop System powered by Agentic-AI, utilizing a multi-agent architecture. This system will be a collaborative platform built on top of SharePoint, provide automated monitoring of SDO websites with notifications, and enable users to easily query standards and gain insights through a chat assistant powered by  RAG.


Key Features
Automated Standards Document Monitoring
Impact Analysis & Comparison .
AI-Driven  Summarizations.
Real time Notifications & Alerts(Teams & Outlook)
AI powered Search & Retrieval(Chatbot)
Centralized Knowledge Repository(SharePoint)
Collaborative Review & Annotations 


Input
Telecom standards documents (DOC, DOCX)



Output
AI-powered insights, summaries and query assistance. UI for file-management in sharepoint and Crawler to monitor new standard releases.

Solution
The web app leverages Python FastAPI backend and React frontend for seamless user experience. An AI-powered agentic framework extracts metadata, performs semantic and text-based comparisons, and automates impact analysis on old vs new standards. A dedicated crawler agent enables real-time monitoring of SDO or allows users to manually upload new documents. Automated notifications keep all stakeholders informed with timely impact analysis on updated standards. Additionally, users can easily query standards and gain actionable insights through an AI-powered chat assistant (RAG-enabled).
